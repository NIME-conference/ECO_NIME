# Data Art for Climate Action (DACA) 

Data Art for Climate Action (DACA) is a dual-hub conference on interactive sonification and visualisation for climate science communication.

##  About this event
DACA is about sonification and visualisation of climate data with a purpose of exploration, awareness, education, and action. As a dual-hub conference (physical events at two locations that are connected over the Internet), DACA is a focal point for researchers, artists, activists, and students, to meet, discuss, and learn from each other. DACA will support a wide, open source dissemination of knowledge. The organisers actively work towards diversity, firstly in regards to gender, age, and geography, and pledge to have equal numbers of men and women among invited speakers.
