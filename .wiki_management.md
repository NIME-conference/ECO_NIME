How the ECO_NIME wiki is configured 
===================================

There are two remote Git repositories:

- https://gitlab.com/raulmasu/eco_nime
    - This is the WORKING directory and all new content and edits should be committed here. 
- https://github.com/NIME-conference/ECO_NIME
    - This is the public facing directory, which is pushed to once any pending new entries or edits have been reviewed. 

The public wiki will be viewable with [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com), same as the [NIME cookbook](https://nime.gitbook.io/), which provides a clean readable format for the documentation. (In the future we can evaluate other options, perhaps ideally a permanent, self-hosted website). 

- The current (temporary) URL for the Gitbook ECO_NIME wiki is https://johnnyvenom.gitbook.io/eco_nime; once it is up and running we can add a NIME subdomain so it can live at something like https://eco.nime.org.
