# HOw the ECO\_NIME wiki is configured

There are two remote Git repositories:

* [https://gitlab.com/raulmasu/eco\_nime](https://gitlab.com/raulmasu/eco_nime)
  * This is the WORKING directory and all new content and edits should be committed here. 
* [https://github.com/NIME-conference/ECO\_NIME](https://github.com/NIME-conference/ECO_NIME)
  * This is the public facing directory, which is pushed to once any pending new entries or edits have been reviewed. 

The public wiki will be viewable with [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com), same as the [NIME cookbook](https://nime.gitbook.io/), which provides a clean readable format for the documentation. \(In the future we can evaluate other options, perhaps ideally a permanent, self-hosted website\).

* The current \(temporary\) URL for the Gitbook ECO\_NIME wiki is [https://johnnyvenom.gitbook.io/eco\_nime](https://johnnyvenom.gitbook.io/eco_nime); once it is up and running we can add a NIME subdomain so it can live at something like [https://eco.nime.org](https://eco.nime.org). 

Questions and comments can be directed to the NIME environmental officers:
