# Streaming and download 

## Summary of Issue

This article explores the environmental issues related to the digital streaming and download of music. While vinyl and CD sales are still a a pollutant, the recent reliance on digital online services have shifted the majority of the environmental impact to online services. Most of the article is based on Kyle Devine's book *Decomposed: the political ecology of music*.

## Questions Raised

1. What is the carbon footprint of the online digital distribution of music through streaming and download?
2. Which platforms are the most/least polluting and are there alternatives?
3. Is this being addressed in the music community and if so, how?

## Information and recommendations (TL;DR)


## Notes

While CDs and vinyl records are an obvious source of plastic pollution, the environmental impact of online data transfers is less obvious, yet significant. Devine (2019: 157-158) notes that plastic use in the US across all recording formats peaked at 6109600 kilograms in 2000, falling to 7845200 kilograms in 2016, while carbon emissions rose from 157 million kilograms in 2000 to over 200 million kilograms by 2016. These numbers coincide with a fall in the purchase price of music as the medium has moved from vinyls and CDs to downloads: a CD in 2000 sold for 21,59 $ in 2000, while a digital album sold for 10.24 $ in 1994. Obviously, the download industry has been more or les outcompeted by streaming services that now offer unlimited streaming for 9,99 $ per month.

How much data does streaming take?
The different platforms have different streaming qualities with Spotify ranging between 24 kbps (free) and 320 kbps (premium), while Apple Music streams at 256 kbps. The approximate data usage is as follows:
- 24 kbps = 90 MB per hour
- 256 kbps = 1 GB per hour
- 320 kbps = 1.2 GB per hour
For calculating the CO2 emissions, see the article on videoconferencing: here, it is suggested that one GB of data amounts to 0.015 kWh, which, in Germany, would translate to roughly 0.0091 kg of CO2e.
