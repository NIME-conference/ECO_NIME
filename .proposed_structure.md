# Wiki Structure

7-April 2021

As we discussed on our last call (after the first reading group meeting), it will be good to have an organizational structure for the wiki that can include a few different sections - featured works/projects/etc., a space for the working/reading group, and of course the main wiki entries. 

I (Johnny) had given this some thought and propose the following basic structure: 

- **Welcome**
  - The NIME Paper (abstract/link)
  - Our proposed framework? Maybe include info/results from the workshop
- **Issues (the main wiki section, with sub-categories)**
  - Digital tools & techniques for research
  - Service (including conference delivery tools)
  - Hardware
  - Travel
  - etc. (the above categories are just copied form what is on the [contribute](/contribute/README.md) page of the wiki and should be revised)
- **Works/research/calls highlighting environmental issues and action**
  - Profiles of artists, researchers, works
  - Reviews and surveys (eg., environmental action in S. America)
  - Calls and upcoming events/opportunities
- **Working Group**
  - Reading group
    - individual pages? 
    - Books/notes, etc.
  - Other working group activities TBD
