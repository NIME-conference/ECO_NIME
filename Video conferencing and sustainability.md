# Video conferencing and sustainability

## Summary of Issue: 

With NIME moving to a hybrid format, video conferencing and communication will be essential for the conference. Additionally, the spread of COVID-19 has meant that the already established practice of everyday video conference calls has increased manyfold.
While the carbon footprint of video calls is often significantly lower than that of non-local in-person meetings, a number of parameters can be considered in chossing the least polluting technologies and practices.

## Questions Raised:

1. What is the carbon footprint of a video call? 
2. What parameters determine the footprint of video calls?
3. What are the different alternatives for video calls?
4. How does the footprint of video calls relate to that of travel? 

## Information and resources (TL;DR)

## Notes

**Carbon footprint of a video call:**

- The energy efficiency of the internet has been roughly doubling every two years [1].
- Video calls use 250 MB - 1.3 GB of data per participant per hour, depending on the quality [3].
- The most recent reputable peer- reviewed estimate of the energy intensity of the internet found an average of 0.06 kWh per GB for 2015. Assuming that it is still halving every 2 years, it would now be around 0.015 kWh/ GB [3].
- The German grid carbon footprint is (2018) 0.4690 kgCO2e per kWh [5]. Use link [5] to find the footprint of most countries.
- One hour of video conferencing, then, is between 0.0018 and 0.0091 kgCO2e per hour of video conferencing. 

Based on these numbers, a rough calculation of the relationship between virtual and physical attendance for one person from Berlin for next years NIME in Shanghai:
8 hours a day for four days (8 * 4 * 0.0091): 0.292 kg of CO2e. In comparison, a Flight from Berlin to Shanghai: 2.53 tonnes of CO2 

**Video call sustainability parameters:**

- Self-hosting: By self-hosting the conference tools for NIME, we can choose a green provider rather than relying on servers beyond our control. Jitsi allows for self-hosting.
- Peer-to-peer: https://kopano.com/ (paid).
