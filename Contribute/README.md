# ...contribute to ECO_NIME

The ECO_NIME wiki is a community space, and we highly encourage anyone to contribute new entries, additional information and edit to existing pages. The wiki lives as a public [Git repository](https://github.com/NIME-conference/ECO_NIME), and is published with [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com).

The repository is softly curated by the NIME environmental officers. If you would like to contribute, we ask that you <a href="mailto:johnny@johnnyvenom.com?subject=ECO_NIME new submission">submit requests by email</a> for additions and edits.

To maintain a consistent format for all entries, a [template](template.md) is provided. Please use this when submitting new content. Markdown (.md) files are the preferred format, however submissions of any type may be submitted.
