## Summary of Issue: 

With NIME moving to a hybrid format, video conferencing and communication will be essential for the conference. Additionally, the spread of COVID-19 has meant that the already established practice of everyday video conference calls has increased manyfold.
While the carbon footprint of video calls is often significantly lower than that of non-local in-person meetings, a number of parameters can be considered in chossing the least polluting technologies and practices.

## Questions Raised:

1. What is the carbon footprint of a video call? 
2. What parameters determine the footprint of video calls?
3. What are the different alternatives for video calls?
4. How does the footprint of video calls relate to that of travel?
