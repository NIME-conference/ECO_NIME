# Info

## How the ECO_NIME wiki is configured

There are two remote Git repositories:

* [https://gitlab.com/raulmasu/eco_nime](https://gitlab.com/raulmasu/eco_nime)
  * This is the WORKING repository and all new content and edits should be committed here. 
* [https://github.com/NIME-conference/ECO_NIME](https://github.com/NIME-conference/ECO_NIME)
  * This is the public facing repository, which is pushed to once any pending new entries or edits have been reviewed. 

The public wiki is viewable with [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com) at [eco.nime.org](https://eco.nime.org) which provides a clean readable format for the documentation. This is synchronized with the NIME Github repository, so any changes pushed there are automatically pushed to the Gitbook as well. (In the future we can evaluate other hosting options, such as a permanent, self-hosted website).

Questions and comments can be directed to the NIME environmental officers:
