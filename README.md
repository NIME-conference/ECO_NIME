# README

To support sustainable practices within and beyond NIME as outlined in the [NIME Conference Environmental Statement](https://www.nime.org/environment/), we have created this repository containing information and green resources for environmental issues in NIME research. It will be continuously updated and contain information, ideas, and suggestions for how we can lessen our individual as well as institutional footprint. The repository is softly curated by the environmental officers, and we highly encourage everyone to [submit requests](mailto:johnny@johnnyvenom.com?subject=ECO_NIME%20new%20submission) for additions and edits. We hope that this will become a resource, not only for evaluating our environmental impact but also spawn new ideas, designs, sonic works, and collaborations, possibly having an impact also beyond the boundaries of NIME research.

> This repository is currently in development [here](https://github.com/NIME-conference/ECO_NIME); once active, we envision it being available at NIME.org, possibly with a form for community submissions.

To maintain a consistent format for all entries, a [template](_template.md) is provided. Please use this when submitting new content. Markdown \(.md\) files are the preferred format.
