# Book Club / Discussion Group

*For sustainable music technology research and practice*

---

As part of efforts to stimulate conversation and action related to the environment, climate change, and how to conduct research sustainably, we formed a working group that has taken the form of a book club. We meet roughly monthly, and for each meeting have a selected reading to discuss and reflect on how we can directly engage with environmental topics through our research and creative work. 

This section of the Eco Wiki will include reports from previous meetings and other information and resources from the group. 

The meetings are informal and anyone is welcome to be a part. For more information or to be added to the email list, send a message to any of the [NIME environmental officers](https://eco.nime.org/#contact) or chat with us at NIME 2021!
